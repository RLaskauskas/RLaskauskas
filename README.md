## Hi there! :)

This is the profile of Rimantas Laskauskas. :) I am currently working as a Senior Animator at Meinart Animation Studio. I am aiming to transition my role into data analytics. To achieve this goal, I joined Turing College's data analytics program at the end of May 2024. Since then, with the help of my studies, I have learned how to conduct data analysis and presentation using:

- Excel/Google Sheets
- SQL
- Python (Pandas)
- Tableau

I am currently actively seeking a junior data analyst position where I could utilize the skills I have acquired and contribute meaningfully to the team's success.
